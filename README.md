# CPU Scheduling Simulator App

## Overview

The **CPU Scheduling Simulator App** is a Java-based desktop application designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides an interactive and visual way for users to understand the mechanics and performance of different scheduling techniques, such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and others.

This project was developed as part of **Base Learning 4** in my university coursework, aimed at enhancing understanding of operating system concepts.
